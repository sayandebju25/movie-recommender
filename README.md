# 🎬 Movie Recommender System  

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using machine learning and deployed with **Streamlit**. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Movie recommendations using ML algorithms  
✅ User-friendly Streamlit interface  
✅ Pretrained model for efficient predictions  
✅ Google Drive integration for `.pkl` file downloading  

## 🛠️ Project Structure  
- **`app.py`** → Streamlit application for the recommender system  
- **`Google_pkl_file_downloder.py`** → Downloads the `.pkl` model file from Google Drive  
- **`Movie_Recommender_System_Data_Analysis.ipynb`** → Jupyter Notebook for model training and data analysis  
- **`requirements.txt`** → List of dependencies for running the project  

## 📌 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayandebju25/movie-recommender.git
   cd movie-recommender
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the trained model using:  
   ```bash
   python Google_pkl_file_downloder.py
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
